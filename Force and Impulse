To apply force to an object

1. Need a direction of the force (vector)
2. Actor or Object

Actor.h

Declare a vector
FVector ForceToAdd = FVector(0,0,5000) // object will move 5000 units per sec towards z direction

Actor.cpp

Implement the function

&Object->AddForce(ForceToAdd * (&Object->GetMass())


While for impulse (burst force)

Actor.cpp

&Object->AddImpulse(ForceToAdd * (&Object->GetMass())
