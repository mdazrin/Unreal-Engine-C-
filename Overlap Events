Create custom triggerbox from TriggerBox class

TriggerBox.h
Override BeginPlay() function

Declare two functions, go-in and go-out

	UFUNCTION()
		void OnTriggerEnter(AActor* OverlapedActor, AActor* OtherActor);

	UFUNCTION()
		void OnTriggerExit(AActor* OverlapedActor, AActor* OtherActor);


TriggerBox.cpp

Register functions under BeginPlay()

	OnActorBeginOverlap.AddDynamic(this, &AMyTriggerBox::OnTriggerEnter
  
	OnActorEndOverlap.AddDynamic(this, &AMyTriggerBox::OnTriggerExit);

Outside BeginPlay(), write the function implementation

Create Blueprint of the class, put in on the level
