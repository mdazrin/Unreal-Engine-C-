To perform radial raycast we needs few parameters

1. Array of HitResult
2. Origin location
3. End location
4. 3D rotation (since in radial)
5. Collision channel
6. Shape we want our trace to be

Origin = GetActorLocation()
End location.z += SphereHeight()

After that, switch to cpp file and under BeginPlay()

GetWorld()->SweepMultiByChannel(1,2,3,4,5,6);

if (true)
{
  iterate array 
  get information of the objects
  
  }
